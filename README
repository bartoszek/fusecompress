Bugs:
	File becames unreadable when it hits not enought space condition. So
	be careful to really have enought free space on the disk to store all data.

	There is a memory leak (not too big, user detects it after milions of
	copyied files) in file utility, more exactly in it's magic library
	(or I don't understand it's API):

Requires:

	boost 1.33.1

	libz
	libbz2
	liblzma = 4.999.5alpha (Download source from http://tukaani.org/lzma/)
	liblzo2

Compile:

	Boost's libraries may be stored in /usr/lib64 on 64bit systems,
	configure script needs to be called with:

	./configure --with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib64/

	Don't use --enable-debug flag. Build fails during linking with boost
	libraries.

	If you don't have pkg-tool installed, try following:

	FUSE_CFLAGS="-D_GNU_SOURCE -D_REENTRANT -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112L -D_POSIX_SOURCE -D_SVID_SOURCE -D_BSD_SOURCE -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500 -pedantic -Wno-long-long -Wall -fpermissive -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -DFUSE_USE_VERSION=26" FUSE_LIBS="-lfuse" ./configure --with-boost=/usr/include/ --with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib64

Usage:

	See man pages for fusecompress and fusecompress_offline.
